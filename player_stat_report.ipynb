    "# Title: Determining the Current Rank of Tennis Players\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Global player rankings provide interesting and valuable insights into professional tennis performances. Players earn points based on their top 18 performances of the past 52 weeks at events hosted by one of the major governing bodies of the sport. Top performers earn significant prize money at major tournaments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we investigated the following question: Can the current rank of professional tennis players be predicted through factors such as best rank achieved throughout their career, total prize money earned, and seasons played at the professional level? This provided an interesting sports analytics question, and the results can potentially help in predicting future player rankings, which has economic and entertainment value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we used is “Player Stats for Top 500 Players'' from ultimatetennisstatistics.com. This dataset compiles individual player data for the 500 highest ranked professional tennis players, including a variety of different categories.\n"
